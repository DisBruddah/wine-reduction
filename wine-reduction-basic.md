# Red Wine Reduction (basic)

## Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon of oil (grapeseed, flaxseed, or avocado)
* 1 shallot (sliced)
* 1 clove garlic (minced)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cup red wine 
* 2 cups chicken stock
* 1 spring of thyme
* 1 tablespoon butter
* Salt and pepper (to taste)

## Process
1. Place a sauce pan on stove top and bring to a low-medium heat
2. Add the oil, shallots, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme into a sauce pan 
	- Gently stir until aromatic vapors are released
	- Be careful not to overcook (i.e., burn) the minced garlic
3. Add red wine into sauce pan
	- Adjust the heat of your stove range to bring the wine to a gentle simmer
	- Reduce the wine until it is nearing a syrup-like consistency
4. Add the chicken stock
	- Reduce until almost *nappant*- the consistency at which a sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
5. Remove the sauce pan off heat from the stove top
6. Strain the contents of the sauce pan into a bowl using a *sieve* to separate the liquid sauce from the solid ingredients
	- Reclaim as much liquid sauce from the solid ingredients as best as you can
7. Pour the liquid sauce back into the sauce pan, place sauce pan back on stove, and bring up to a gentle simmer. Reduce until *nappant*.
8. Remove the sauce pan off heat from the stove top and let the sauce cool for a minute or two. You do not want the sauce liquid to be too hot for the next step.
9. Add the butter to the sauce pan and constantly stir in the butter with a whisk until the butter emulsifies into the sauce.
10. Add salt and ground pepper (freshly cracked is preferred) to taste.
11. Serve your red wine reduction sauce with your dish
